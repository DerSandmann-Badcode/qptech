Phase 1 Roadmap:
- need an assembly (crafting) machine
- need an auto-smithing machine
- electric oven, hob - maybe combination? Maybe stainless steel?
- dejank

Phase 2:
- focus on resource collection & higher end power
  - oil/pump jacks
  - distallation tower
  - gas power plant
  - mining machines
  - farming
 
Phase 3:
- focus on construction enhancements
  - excavation machines
  - item storage

Phase 4:
- ? Future tech ?

1.10.3-pre.5
- added some language entries for phrases, instead of hardcoding (will improve over time)
  - fixed Liquid Rubber in tank name
- added recipes
   - can now make hardened screw press from a soft screw press plus an iron machine block
   - can now make steel fluid tank from industrial glass and steel channels
   - added molybdochalkos plates to the plate presses


1.10.3-pre.4
- Added a recipe to make vanilla Metal Parts (Helps if you also have R&R installed)
- Added sawmill 1 log -> 16 planks (temp graphics same as log splitter)
- Machines should now show proper input and output sides automatically
- removed heat requirement for "hard screw press"

1.10.3-pre.3
- Be sure to check out the qptech wiki! Http://qptech.wiki
- temporal condenser will now work in worlds where temporal stability has been disabled
- Rubber Mold machine now called Parts Mold
- new parts:
  - vacuum tube (added recipe to parts mold)
  - vacuum tube casing (with grid recipe)
  - Crude Circuit board now uses a vacuum tube
  - new Temporal Circuit board has the crude circuit board's recipe
- changes:
  - Crusher Module recipe:
     - can use any metal for pounder cap
     - can use any screw type
  - Industrial Blower:
     - can use any circuit board type, including newly modified crude circuit board, so temporal steel (and mixer) not required
  - Macerator increase resin out put from logs
  - primitive electric motor can be made with any machine plate or rod
  - can make smelter furance with iron



1.10.2
- Be sure to check out the qptech wiki! Http://qptech.wiki
- added iron machinery block, can be used instead of bronze for:
   - clayformer
   - electric forge
   - electric kiln
   - primitive generator
   - logsplitter
   - macerator
   - metal punch
   - crusher module
- all recipes that used brass screws should now be able to use any screws
- lvpunch can now handle steel & iron, since it is such a limited use machine
- added a Hardened Screw Cutter - can make steel & brass screws, get 16 screws per rod
- added a wiki link in the guide
