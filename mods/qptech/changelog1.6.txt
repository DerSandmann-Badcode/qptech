QPTECH 1.6.0 Change Log
- VS 1.16
- fixed Tanks to use new water portion units
- fixed pipe network to use new water portion units
- fixed boiler water usage
- fixed prim generator water usage
- fixed water tower water generation and storage
- adding sound to industrial generator
- adding sound set up to BEEBaseDevice
- added wiremill sound (more as a test)
- added washplant sound

- roughed in steam particles and sound for boiler block
- added sound for BEProcessToProcess
- increase boiler water usage
[dev]Added BEAnimator test class and anitest object
- added "Running" to BEProcessToProcess and BEProcessToProcess Fluid fixes particles always running on boiler
- primitive/creative generator animations running again \o/
- added simple turbine Animation and sound
[dev]Implemented animations for BEProcessToProcess, needs attribute runAnimation

- added crusher model

- added crusher animation
[dev] implemented animations for BEEBaseDevice
- added bloomery model
- Added crusher sound

- batteries now power from all directions (updated graphic)
- added sheet roller animation
- changing BEEBaseDevice to run off of milliseconds instead of ticks (easier to setup and sync with animations)
- changing BEERecipeProcessor to run off of milliseconds
- most devices will stop animation/doing particles etc if not in use
- added lathe animation
- added wiremill animation
- sounds won't run if Processing supplier (ie crusher) isn't active
- fixed: boiler using water way to fast
- readded animations for metal press based machines and clayforming based machines (produciton time now 3 sec)
- readded animations to washplant and macerator

1.6.1
- macerator: added ore-quartz -> crushed-quartz and stone-bauxite->crushed-bauxite

todo - macertaor - ore-quartz, stone-bauxite -> crushed-quartz, crushed-bauxite
[dev]Making a test block seeker class
- added bloomworker - iron bloom to ingot machine makeable at iron age
- bugfix weird empty electric forge contents

- todo - fix bloom worker running with no heat, and reduce sound
- logsplitter - needs to hand logsection - slow down logsplitter - add logsplitter animation

1.6.2
- limestone added to macerator
- washplant has chance to drop limestone from gravel
- macerator game:bone->game:bonemeal
[dev]Roughed in drill
- note to self: check grinding props attribute for macerator? -> add cinnabar
- adding concrete recipes
- adding mining drill sounds particles

1.6.3
- electric forge slighly increased max heat so you have time to transfer to machines if heating manually
- bugfix: macerator etc still plays sound and animates when switched off
- added maceration recipe: stone-chalk->lime
- added recipe list ui for Recipe Processor type machines (wiremill and bloomery)
- electrical devices have a status ui, right click on device to view - and also turn device on or off
- heater device will heat up contents of neighboring chests (with a heatingefficiency setting)
- crucible block: can be set to alloy or single mode, will pour ingots based on available heated items in input hatch
   *will only process exact quantitites
- changed steam boiler to require the "combustion" processing type - which right now is provided by the industrial bronze firepit
(to prevent infinite power issues)
- changed carrying capacity integration to patch based (should clear errors)

1.6.4
- bugfix: crash when shift-right clicking clayformer with no item
- todo: add particle effects for block heating
- todo: crucible won't store its stack to the tree - issue with set stack?
- todo: crucible and heater recipes
- clayformer: unify and use a UI?
