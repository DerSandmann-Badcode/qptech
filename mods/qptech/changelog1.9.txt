1.10.1
- added temporal pocket
- added temporal condenser
- added charged temporal steel ingot, plate, and sheet
- need better rubber texture
- fixed crash with BEERecipeProcessor based machines
- added Rubber Mold Machine - pipe in rubber, add heat, and get rubber sheets out
- added rubber sheets (made in new rubber mold machien), and rubber gaskets (made for now with knife + rubber sheet)
Mold Machine
- steel mold (or iron?)
- steel machinery block
- cables
- requires heat
Balance:
- motors now only require 1 steel sheet instead of 2
- braided wire now only requires 3 wires instead of 4 (manual recipe)
- rotors now need two rods instead of 1 but stators use 1 ring instead of 2

IDEAS:
- saw mill for planks
- something to make charcoal


1.9.0
- fixed a server error loop with item transport
- added: Mining Drill!
   - right click on a bucket or barrel etc with drill to fuel with alcoholic spirits (brandies etc)
   - press F to bring up the mining pattern
   - drill head is made with steel on an anvil - the drill head will slowly wear down instead of the drill
      - to replace the drill head press F with the drill and drop the drill head into any of the mode select buttons
    - in creative mode drill head doesn't wear and fuel isn't consumed, although it can be refueled
