TODO (for 1.10.1 release):
? Fix mining drill leaving highlight blocks around

1.10.1
Temporal Pockets!
- added temporal condenser
- added charged temporal steel ingot, plate, and sheet
- need better rubber texture
- fixed crash with BEERecipeProcessor based machines
- added Rubber Mold Machine - pipe in rubber, add heat, and get rubber sheets out
- added rubber sheets (made in new rubber mold machine), and rubber gaskets (made for now with knife + rubber sheet)
Mold Machine
- currently used to make rubber sheets from liquid rubber
- steel mold (or iron?)
- steel machinery block
- cables
- requires heat
Electric Pyrolysis Kiln
- can make charcoal from sticks, or firewood. Can also make coke from coal.
- inputs from left outputs to right
- requires powered heater (lv heater for charcoal, mv heater for coke), and industrial fan blocks beside it


Balance: (goal to let you at least build something with your first steel cook)
- motors now only require 1 steel sheet instead of 2
- braided wire now only requires 3 wires instead of 4 (manual recipe)
- rotors now need two rods instead of 1 but stators use 1 ring instead of 2
- advanced bloomery only requires 1 steel pipe
Fixes:
- BEEAssembler Based devices (mainly presses) now have power on/off buttons
- Recipe Processor based machines should try to put more than a single item into output slots if possible
- Recipe Processor machines were instantly fixing recipes that were missing processing steps
- when in creative mode copper cables are no longer used up when linking machines

IDEAS:
- saw mill for planks
- keyed inventory - some kind of programmable, copyable key
    - could in theory generate like "treasure chests" - create keys, and save inventory
-cast iron oven upgrade - make interior like a clay oven, and the hob like a firepit
- sheet roller should be changed to an recipe processor and add in ingots->plates
- need moar particles (esp Electric Pyrolysis Kiln)


1.9.0
- fixed a server error loop with item transport
- added: Mining Drill!
   - right click on a bucket or barrel etc with drill to fuel with alcoholic spirits (brandies etc)
   - press F to bring up the mining pattern
   - drill head is made with steel on an anvil - the drill head will slowly wear down instead of the drill
      - to replace the drill head press F with the drill and drop the drill head into any of the mode select buttons
    - in creative mode drill head doesn't wear and fuel isn't consumed, although it can be refueled
