TODO:
- special rails placement ew/ns depending on facing
- placed carts should start in direction player is facing
- extend signals somehow
- recipes needed:
    - carts
    - vanilla rails
    - vertical rails
    - switches
    - detector rails
    - switching rails
- future stuff:
    - block behaviour for signals, or interface
1.10.1
Temporal Pockets!
- added temporal condenser
- added charged temporal steel ingot, plate, and sheet
- need better rubber texture
- fixed crash with BEERecipeProcessor based machines
- added Rubber Mold Machine - pipe in rubber, add heat, and get rubber sheets out
- added rubber sheets (made in new rubber mold machine), and rubber gaskets (made for now with knife + rubber sheet)
Mold Machine
- currently used to make rubber sheets from liquid rubber
- steel mold (or iron?)
- steel machinery block
- cables
- requires heat
Minecarts!
- currently uses vanilla wooden rails, and custom vertical rails
- auto switching tracks *can be locked with wrench
- load and unload into containers (above to load, below to unload)
- railway switches will change direction of switching rails
- detector rail will flip railway switches and switching rails
Balance: (goal to let you at least build something with your first steel cook)
- motors now only require 1 steel sheet instead of 2
- braided wire now only requires 3 wires instead of 4 (manual recipe)
- rotors now need two rods instead of 1 but stators use 1 ring instead of 2
- advanced bloomery only requires 1 steel pipe
Fixes:
- BEEAssembler Based devices (mainly presses) now have power on/off buttons

IDEAS:
- saw mill for planks
- something to make charcoal
- keyed inventory - some kind of programmable, copyable key
    - could in theory generate like "treasure chests" - create keys, and save inventory


1.9.0
- fixed a server error loop with item transport
- added: Mining Drill!
   - right click on a bucket or barrel etc with drill to fuel with alcoholic spirits (brandies etc)
   - press F to bring up the mining pattern
   - drill head is made with steel on an anvil - the drill head will slowly wear down instead of the drill
      - to replace the drill head press F with the drill and drop the drill head into any of the mode select buttons
    - in creative mode drill head doesn't wear and fuel isn't consumed, although it can be refueled
