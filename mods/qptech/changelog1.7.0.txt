1.7.0
- moving item pipe mesh generation outside of OnTesselation
- Mixer purges to below fluid tank directly
- several blocks made ground storable, thanks Craluminium!

1.7.0.pre3
- itempipes will adjust scale of items a little better, tiny items won't get scaled down as much or at all as larger items
- itempipe mesh generation moved outside of OnTesselation to improve performance
- Bloomery machine can now work blister steel ingots, now called Advanced Bloomery Machine
- started adding some helpful links and such in item descriptions
- added coal pile stoker - will keep coke/coal piles fed (loaded via item pipes)
- tweak from pre2 - item pipes are slower but don't require circuit boards (this will be left for an advanced version)
	- item splitters don't require circuit boards
	- coal stoker requires a chip
- bugfixes - hopefully stabilized some of the devices erroring out and doing weird stuff
- adjusted height of display items running thru pipes
- heating coils now stack so mv heater can actually be made!

1.7.0.pre2
- need to add recipe for computer
- fixed: some machines stuck on warmpup
- found a potential crash with itemsplitter
- Recipe processor recipe lists can be partially matched
- added all concrete colors and mixer recipes
- mixer stays in purge mode until manually disabled
- fixed bug: mixer won't change liquid types even when empty

1.7.0.pre1 - item transport update
- added filterable item transport pipes
   - filter by: allow/block text, turn on/off, only transfer minimum quantity at a time
- added item 3 and 4 way splitters
- fixed assembler type machines to try harder to find open slots
- added tablet computer - useful for setting and copying filters on pipes
- adding multiblock texture test
- added industrial glass, made in a mixer from water and crushed glass
- added steel channels
- added circuit board part
- (experimental!)ropes and power poles for power transfer.
- mv heater quartered power usage to 32 tf
- doubled mv generator power output to 64 tf
- added temporal steel ingot, plate, and sheet - temporal steel ingots made in mixer (1 temporal gear+8 steel ingots -> 8 temporal steel ingots)
- added mixer object - hit with pipe wrench to purge the internal tank of liquid. Input dry materials on left and output dry materiasl on right. Attach a pipe to back or bottom to fill or drain liquids
- fixed recipes for castiron ovens
- concrete now made only in mixer (needs water or dye, plus quicklime, sand, and stones)
- machine recipe ingredients can now be partially matched (eg: sand- would accept any ingredient that contained sand- in its code)


- future todo:

- need steel processing
- fluid pipes - have a fluid limiter for allowing thru certain quantity of fluid?
- itempipes will eventually have option to turn off item rendering - but how to turn on/off?
- coal pile loader/cementation furnace machine - find coffin with inventory - can check if it's full and if it is keep pit lit and loaded, otherwise let it burn out
