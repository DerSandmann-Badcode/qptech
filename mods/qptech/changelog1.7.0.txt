1.7.0 - item transport update
- added filterable item transport pipes
- added item 3 and 4 way splitters
- fixed assembler type machines to try harder to find open slots

todo: Need a pipe tool or computer or something that can hold filters and copy them to other things (probably
    need to make the GUI more abstract)
