1.3
- bugfix - tools counted as chisels when broken (and vice versa)
- add command /qpchisel-resetdefaults - resets tool usage settings to their defaults
- added Pantograph
	- Pantograph basic operaitons - left click a chiseld block to copy its shape, then right click on other chiseld blocks to apply that shape
		- it keeps the destination shapes materials (if the origin has more materials than the destination then the first material is used)
	- mode set with F
		- Full Paste mode - replaces the entire shape for the block
		- Paste Add mode - adds the copied block to the destination block (won't replace any voxels of the original block)
	- access undo with F (undoes the very last paste operation if possible)
	- command to set tool usage: /qpchisel-pantograph-toolusage 0.25
	- can only be made with steel
	


1.2
- added Hand Wedge tool - shift the voxels of chiseled blocks 1 voxel at a time!
- (internal) Refactor code to use a single routine for modifying blocks (preparing for other tools)

1.1.2
- can only make hand planer with iron and better (previously made tools will still exist)
- implemented tool durability
- implemented tool durability server config
- implemented server command to change hand planer tool usage:
	/qpchisel-handplaner-toolusage (Set how fast hand planer gets damaged when used. Default is 0.125)
- added a sound
- new hand planer model from Andy!
- bugfix: west and north face shift+left click doubles sometimes
