1.4.5
- Added config option "fixedToolWear" - if true then the pantograph will always use pantographMinimumDamagePerOp for tool wear, ignoring number of voxels and ignoring pantographBaseDurabilityModifier
- fixed a warning about a missing texture (thanks AleDark)
- fixed a possible memory leak (thanks AleDark)
* fix for ghost blocks

1.4.4
- bugfix: Copied Block data was global - so copying and pasting would get mixed up between users, now stored in stack data which also means that a copy is saved on a pantograph,even if you log out etc
	- also applies to undo data for all three tools

	[idea - store the undo info in the microblocks stack attributes instead? Then any tool could restore it]

1.4.3
- left click pantograph sound fixed
- tools will no longer alter reinforced blocks (note you can still copy a reinforced block just not alter it)


1.4.2
- hotfix pantograph crash

1.4.1
- enable left click to copy with pantograph again...idk what i was thinking xD
- tool rack storage


1.4
- further reduced pantograph damage
- pantograph - now only does right click function, if you want to copy change to copy mode (should help to prevent some accidents)
	- plays snapshot sound when take copy
	- plays scribble sound when pasting shapes
- quieter wedge and hand planer

1.3.1
- hiding uncraftable variants of the hand planer (bronze/copper)
- handbook update
- remove "copy of for copied blocks"
- tools default to 50x less durability usage (run command: /qpchisel-resetdefaults if you want to reset)
- pantograph added iron & meteoriciron variant

1.3
- bugfix - tools counted as chisels when broken (and vice versa)
- add command /qpchisel-resetdefaults - resets tool usage settings to their defaults
- added Pantograph
	- Pantograph basic operaitons - left click a chiseld block to copy its shape, then right click on other chiseld blocks to apply that shape
		- it keeps the destination shapes materials (if the origin has more materials than the destination then the first material is used)
	- mode set with F
		- Full Paste mode - replaces the entire shape for the block
		- Paste Add mode - adds the copied block to the destination block (won't replace any voxels of the original block)
	- access undo with F (undoes the very last paste operation if possible)
	- command to set tool usage: /qpchisel-pantograph-toolusage 0.25
	- can only be made with steel
- new for Hand Planer & Hand Wedge:
	- add mode select and undo, press F to bring up menu
	- crouch click no longer does anything different, you can change modes with the "F" menu
		- modes:
			Add/Remove Any (will delete or add an entire plane of voxels)
			Add/Remove Material (will delete/add only the targeted material)
			Undo - not really a mode, but clicking this will attempt to undo the last operation
			*The Hand Wedge ignores modes (but undo will still work)

1.2
- added Hand Wedge tool - shift the voxels of chiseled blocks 1 voxel at a time!
- (internal) Refactor code to use a single routine for modifying blocks (preparing for other tools)

1.1.2
- can only make hand planer with iron and better (previously made tools will still exist)
- implemented tool durability
- implemented tool durability server config
- implemented server command to change hand planer tool usage:
	/qpchisel-handplaner-toolusage (Set how fast hand planer gets damaged when used. Default is 0.125)
- added a sound
- new hand planer model from Andy!
- bugfix: west and north face shift+left click doubles sometimes
